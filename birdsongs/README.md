## About ðŸ¦†

 **Birdsongs** is an ear-training app for backyard birders. Specifically designed for beginning birdwatchers, Birdsongs harnesses the power of the Xeno-Canto API to familiarize users with vocalizations recorded by state. Users can browse thousands of user-uploaded field recordings from their area, or target their search on a specific bird genus, species, or type, allowing you to explore an almost endless variety of birdcalls from across the United States. Whether you're looking retired, chronically-single, planning the murder of that bird that keeps waking you up at 5:00am, or you just really, really like birds, Birdsongs is the ideal app to help your birdcall recall take flight.

## Context ðŸ¦‰

Birdsongs was a solo project built during the developer's third semester enrolled in [Turing School of Software & Design's Front End Development program](https://frontend.turing.edu/), a four-semester, eight-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The project was built to match the specifications of the [project rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html), and represents my third React application. In addition to pushing me to rise to the challenge of this still-new framework, Birdsongs also required me to incorporate the following languages, technologies, and competencies:  
  * Test-Driven Development utilizing the Cypress framework
  * URL customization and browser compatibility via Router 
  * Network requests & API data 
  * Proptype checking
  * Peer-reviewed pull requests 
  * Git workflow
  * [Vercel](link)
  * [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/emlindvall/projects/2/views/1)

## Goals and Challenges ðŸ¦©

Birdsongs was developed over the course of just five days, which meant that time management was the most difficult aspect of this project. Considered the semester's "showcase project", I tackled this build during the busiest time of the semester, and needed to diligently balance time spent on Birdsongs with time spent studying and preparing for my final assessment. This meant that I needed to stick to a very narrow minimum viable product, and avoid the dreaded "scope creep" like the plague-- harder said than done when you're really excited about the product you're building. I often had to tell myself "no" in order to keep my plate responsibly balanced, and had to choose what areas of the application to dedicate my time to very, very carefully. 

I also took on the challenge of self-teaching and applying React hooks for this particular project. Although I found them fairly intuitive, the process of learning this new syntax without guidance from my instructors or the Turing curriculum necessitated lots of quality time spent with the React documentation, a lot of smart Googling, and a lot of conscientious experimentation. 

## Future Development Opportunities ðŸ¦†
I fully intend to return to Birdsongs very soon. My vision is to turn Birdsongs into a more active educational experience, centering its functionality on a birdcall quiz utilizing recordings from the user's selected location. I'd love to integrate some sort of a points system, maybe a streak-tracker, or even a leaderboard. This would mean incorporating user authentication, much more robust form validation, and an expansion of the currently-available search terms, just to name a few starting points. I'd also like to feature a random recording each day, and create functionality for browsing birdcalls randomly, rather than based on specific search criteria. Stay tuned!
